ldesc: "Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) is an Open Source, free of charge 
graphic library, written in industrially standard C++. AGG doesn't 
depend on any graphic API or technology. Basically, you can think of AGG 
as of a rendering engine that produces pixel images in memory from some 
vectorial data. But of course, AGG can do much more than that."
